Description: A collection of my personal utility functions. I use these functions 
	in my day to day work on database studies with the German Pharmacoepidemiological 
	Research Database (GePaRD) and make them public here in case any other BIPS folk 
	find them useful. The package requires at least R version 4, since I use the native 
	pipe operator.
